# Maximizing_Xsell_Opportunities
In the increasingly competitive environment for banks and credit unions, every potential advantage should be pursued. One of these advantages is to market additional products to our existing customers rather than to new customers, since our existing customers already know (and hopefully trust) us, and we have so much data on them. But how can this best be done? How can we market the right products to the right customers at the right time? Predictive analytics can do this by forecasting which customers have the highest chance of purchasing a given financial product.

This project shows a step-by-step approach to maximize cross-sell opportunities among our customer. We first prepare the data for a statistical analysis. With some predictive analytics technqiues, we can then identify those customers who have the highest chance of buying a financial product. 


This project is written in SAS Enterprise Guide. The methodology used is Logistic Regression with WOE transformation. Information Value (IV) and Permutation Feature Importance are used to rank the predicting power of predictors.
